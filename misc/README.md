# Miscellaneous

This directory contains scripts which I did not really know where to put else.

There are upposed to be fun little scripts in here, 
that don't serve a particular purpose, or
other tools that may be handy at one point or another.

For example `ii2l.bash` asks the question whether or not it is too late,
while `runJabRef.bash` is a wrapper to JabRef.

```

└── README.md
