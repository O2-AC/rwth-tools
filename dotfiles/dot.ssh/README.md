# `dot.ssh`

This directory contains a configuration file for the dialog systems
of the RWTH RZ cluster.
It should be placed as `~/.ssh`. 
Paste your **public** ssh-key to the file `authorised_keys` for
easier switching of the dialog systems. 
The file `known_hosts` is a blank and will be generated 
by the system automatically when you login. 
There is no actual need to have it in the first place,
this is just a reminder that the file will exist at some point.
